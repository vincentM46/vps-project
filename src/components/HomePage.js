            <p>The goal of this project was to deliver a convenient method of gathering various meal ideas in one place! Through usage of various API's, this project created in React will allow any user to generate a random recipe, as well as a random drink to pair the recipe with!</p>
            <p>Not satisfied with the drink you were given? Feel free to search for a drink that's more to your liking! The VPS bar offers both!</p>
            <h3 className="App-header">The creators of the VPS project would also like to thank you, the user, for visiting our page and giving us a chance to showcase the culmination of our hard work and effort. We would also like to encourage you, the user, to go through our project, utilize the API's, and maybe even discover new recipes and drinks to try out on your own!</h3>
